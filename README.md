# HexPawn
Simple Machine Learning, easy for anyone to understand, using HexPawn as an example. 

Hexapawn is a game created by Martin Gardner, a mathematician and columnist. Before modern AI/machine learning, he demonstrated how a machine could learn to master a game using nothing more than matchboxes. I thought this was such a cool idea that I decided to program it in Java, so you could play for yourself without tedious setup!

My code reads in the text file boxes.txt to construct both players (machine A -> player 1, machine B -> player 2), and then prompts the user to play games or quit.
